Hallo! I'm Noah — a cybersecurity student!

---

## What I'm Studying:

    Towson University
• A.A. Cybersecurity  
    Wor-Wic Community College

## About Me (Barista):
I'm a barista — favorite drink has to be a cortado!
(½ espresso, ½ steamed milk | it lets flavors truly shine and pairs the coffee + milk evenly.)

Medium -> Dark roasts are my preference. I'm always looking for nutty + maple notes, longer roasts makes them come out so smooth :D.

## Downtime?
I LOVE videogames, ever since I was a kid.

Currently playing:
• World of Warcraft (Preservation Evoker / Havoc Demon Hunter)
• Minecraft (Datapack developing and redstone )

All-time favorite?
Hands down Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky..
This game literally reshaped how kid-me started looking at life.
It taught me to appreciate every moment, good and bad.

## Where it all started!!
My first program was "Hello World" in Python at a 2009 library workshop (I was like 7 LOL)
Little-me thought it was actual magic how computers work.
And if you ask me now? It's still magic, we actually tricked rocks into thinking.

## And where are we now?
• Finalizing CS fundamentals (OS, Networking, Algorithms, Hardware).
• Implementing real cybersecurity concepts through labs.
• Swapping from Windows -> Linux (cause windows just has way too much overhead nowadays).
